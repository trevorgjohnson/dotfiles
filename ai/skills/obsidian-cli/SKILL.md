# Obsidian CLI

Use the `obsidian` CLI to interact with a running Obsidian instance. Requires Obsidian to be open.

## Vault Conventions (Core Principals)

Before any write, complex query, or note creation, read `$VAULT_PATH/Core Principals.md`
to load the vault owner's conventions (categories, status values, tag style, date
formats, property patterns, temporal note structures). This file is the single source of
truth for how the vault is organized — derive structure from it, don't hardcode it.

If `Core Principals.md` doesn't exist, interview the user to create it using
`AskUserQuestion`. Walk through the sections below in order. Accept the recommended
default when the user has no preference. After the interview, write the file with all
sections populated.

### General Conventions

| Question | Recommended default |
|---|---|
| Single vault or multiple? | Single vault |
| Folders for organization, or flat? | Flat — no folders |
| Standard Markdown or Obsidian-specific syntax? | Standard Markdown only |
| Singular or plural categories and tags? | Always plural |
| How often do you use internal links? | Profusely — link everything relevant |
| Preferred date format? | `YYYY-MM-DD` everywhere |
| Rating scale? | 7-point (1–7) |
| Reusable property names across note types? | Yes — shared names enable cross-category views |
| Composable templates (stack multiple on one note)? | Yes |
| Short or descriptive property names? | Short — faster to type |
| Default property type for potentially multi-value fields? | `list` — even if currently single-value |

### Categories

Ask the user to list their note categories (e.g. Todos, Projects, Books, Shows).
Document the category property format — recommend `categories: ["[[Name]]"]` with
wikilinks. Note whether category index pages exist and how they work (e.g. embed
`.base` files, carry `tags: [categories]`).

### Key Properties

Ask what frontmatter properties are used for querying and filtering. Build a table
with columns: Property, Used on, Values. At minimum cover: `categories`, `status`,
`start`, `end`, `rating`, `tags`. Add any vault-specific properties the user mentions.

### Status Lifecycle

Ask about status values and their order. Recommend:
`backlog → pending → in progress → blocked (optional) → finished`.
Document any side effects (e.g. `in progress` sets `start`, `finished` sets `end`).

### Tags

Ask about the tag taxonomy. Cover:
- **Scope tags** — primary classification axis (e.g. `work` / `personal`)
- **Priority tags** — urgency markers (e.g. `P0`)
- **Structural tags** — note-type markers (e.g. `weekly`, `daily`, `categories`)
- **Topical tags** — any recurring subject tags

### Temporal Notes

Ask whether the user uses weekly and/or daily notes. For each, document:
- Filename pattern (e.g. `YYYY-Www`, `YYYY-MM-DD`)
- Category assignment
- Key frontmatter properties (`start`, `end`, `prev`, `next`, `parent`, `date`)
- Tags (e.g. `weekly`, `daily`)
- What the body typically embeds

## Step 1 — Detect the CLI

Before the first vault operation, run:

```bash
which obsidian
```

If found, proceed normally. If not found, use `AskUserQuestion` to present the options below — noting the limitations of raw mode so the user can make an informed choice:

---

> The `obsidian` CLI is not installed (or not on your PATH). How would you like to proceed?
>
> **A — Install it** (recommended)
> Follow the guide at https://help.obsidian.md/cli, then come back and re-run the command. Required for: templates, Obsidian sync/history, plugin management, and live vault operations.
>
> **B — Continue without it (raw file I/O)**
> Vault files will be read and written directly with standard tools. Obsidian does not need to be open. Limitations: no template expansion, no sync/history/plugin commands, search uses raw file contents (not Obsidian's index), property types must be maintained manually in YAML.
>
> **C — It's installed but not in PATH**
> Provide the full path to the `obsidian` binary and I'll use it directly this session.

Handle each response:
- **A** → stop and wait; retry the original request once the user confirms install.
- **B** → proceed using [Raw Mode](#raw-mode) for all vault operations.
- **C** → use the provided path in place of `obsidian` for all commands this session.

## Command reference

Run `obsidian help` to see all available commands — this is always up to date.
If anything unexpected happens, fetch `https://help.obsidian.md/cli` and check for syntax changes before retrying.

## Syntax

**Parameters** take a value with `=`. Quote values with spaces:

```bash
obsidian create name="My Note" content="Hello world"
```

**Flags** are boolean switches with no value:

```bash
obsidian create name="My Note" silent overwrite
```

For multiline content use `\n` for newline and `\t` for tab.

## File targeting

Many commands accept `file` or `path`. Without either, the active file is used.

- `file=<name>` — resolves like a wikilink (name only, no path or extension)
- `path=<path>` — exact path from vault root, e.g. `folder/note.md`

## Vault targeting

Commands target the most recently focused vault by default. Use `vault=<name>` as the first parameter to target a specific vault:

```bash
obsidian vault="My Vault" search query="test"
```

## Destructive operations

Before running any destructive command, use `AskUserQuestion` to confirm. Destructive commands include:

- `obsidian create ... overwrite` — overwrites an existing note
- `obsidian property:set` — replaces an existing property value
- `obsidian delete` — deletes a file
- Any command that modifies content that can't be trivially undone

Example confirmation prompt:
```
This will overwrite "My Note" with new content. The existing content will be lost.
Proceed? Yes / No / Show current content first
```

## Common patterns

```bash
obsidian read file="My Note"
obsidian create name="New Note" content="# Hello" template="Template" silent
obsidian append file="My Note" content="New line"
obsidian prepend file="My Note" content="New line"
obsidian search query="search term" limit=10
obsidian search:context query="search term"
obsidian daily:read
obsidian daily:append content="- [ ] New task"
obsidian daily:prepend content="- [ ] New task"
obsidian daily:path
obsidian unique name="My Idea" content="# My Idea"
obsidian property:read name="status" file="My Note"
obsidian property:set name="status" value="done" file="My Note"
obsidian property:remove name="status" file="My Note"
obsidian properties file="My Note"
obsidian tasks daily todo
obsidian tasks file="My Note" verbose
obsidian task ref="folder/note.md:12" toggle
obsidian tags sort=count counts
obsidian backlinks file="My Note"
obsidian links file="My Note"
obsidian files folder="Projects" ext=md
obsidian orphans
obsidian deadends
```

Use `--copy` on any command to copy output to clipboard. Use `silent` to prevent files from opening in Obsidian. Use `total` on list commands to get a count.

## Raw Mode

Raw mode uses Read, Write, Edit, Grep, Glob, and Bash directly on vault files. Obsidian does not need to be open. Resolve the vault root first via the `obsidian-vault` skill (`$VAULT_PATH`).

### Equivalents

| `backlinks file="Note"` | `Grep` for `\[\[Note\]\]` across vault |
| `links file="Note"` | `Grep` for `\[\[` within the file |
| `files ext=md` | `Glob` with `**/*.md` in `$VAULT_PATH` |
| `orphans` | Cross-reference `Glob` results against backlink `Grep` results |

### Frontmatter edits

Always target the specific property line with `Edit` — never rewrite the entire file just to change a property. When adding a new property, insert it inside the existing `---` block.

### Template expansion

When creating a note from a template in raw mode, manually expand all template variables before writing the file. Read `Core Principals.md` for the vault's preferred date format — default is `YYYY-MM-DD`.

**Core template variables** (built into Obsidian's Templates plugin):

| Token | Expands to | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `{{title}}` | The note's filename (no extension) | `2026-W15` |
| `{{date}}` | Today's date in vault default format | `2026-04-07` |
| `{{date:FORMAT}}` | Today's date with a [moment.js format](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/displaying/format/) | `{{date:YYYY}}` → `2026`, `{{date:MMM}}` → `Apr`, `{{date:WW}}` → `15` |
| `{{time}}` | Current time (default `HH:mm`) | `14:30` |
| `{{time:FORMAT}}` | Current time with a moment.js format (same syntax as above) | `{{time:hh:mm a}}` → `02:30 pm` |

**Date Offset plugin variables** (community plugin — `Date Offset: Expand date offset placeholders`):

| Token | Expands to |
|---|---|
| `{{date+1D}}` | Tomorrow |
| `{{date-1D}}` | Yesterday |
| `{{date+1W}}` | One week forward |
| `{{date-1W}}` | One week back |
| `{{date+1W:FORMAT}}` | Offset with format, e.g. `{{date+1W:YYYY}}-W{{date+1W:WW}}` |

Offsets support `D` (days), `W` (weeks), `M` (months), `Y` (years). Format token after `:` is optional and uses the same moment.js syntax.

**Template → rendered example** (Weekly Note Template → `2026-W15`, week starting 2026-04-06):

| Token in template | Rendered value |
|---|---|
| `{{date:YYYY}} {{date:MMM}} Weekly Note` | `2026 Apr Weekly Note` |
| `{{date-1W:YYYY}}-W{{date-1W:WW}}` | `2026-W14` |
| `{{date+1W:YYYY}}-W{{date+1W:WW}}` | `2026-W16` |
| `{{date}}` | `2026-04-06` |
| `{{date+5D}}` | `2026-04-11` |
| `{{date+1D}}` | `2026-04-07` |

When expanding manually, compute all offsets from the note's creation date (or the Monday of the week for weekly notes), not from today if they differ.
