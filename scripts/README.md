# CLI Scripts
This contains multiple useful [bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) scripts to improve cli efficiency.

## Quick Start

There exists a couple prerequisites before using the scripts.
`chmod +x <script name>` will also need to be ran on each script to give it executable permissions.

### Gum

Many of this scripts require the use of the [**gum cli tool**](https://github.com/charmbracelet/gum).
This provides a toolset to improve the experience of using each individual script _(such as the pickers)_.

### Git Aliases

Some [git aliases](../.gitconfig) are required to be configured in your `.gitconfig` such as `git attach`.
